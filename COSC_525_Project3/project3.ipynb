    "## Dataset\n",
    "- You will be using a modified version of the FairFace dataset (https://github.com/joojs/fairface). This is a set of 86,744 training face images and 10,954 validation face images. \n",
    "- In order to decrease the training time I converted all images to gray scale and resized them to 32 × 32. Each face has 3 different attributes which can be used for a classification task: race, gender, and age. All files can be found in the zip file on Canvas. The train folder contains the training images and the fairface label train.csv file contains all the label. There is a similar folder and file for the validation set.\n",
    "- As the three different attributes have a different number of possible values, your final layers for each classifier will vary. For each of the networks below please attempt to classify 2 of the attributes (you can choose which)."
